Term Project
 
 This project focuses on the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) application that applies three different image transformations using traditional computer vision techniques. Our team built this application primarily with OpenCV (cv2) in Python and developed it collaboratively in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Our GUI allows users to upload images and apply transformations through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. To create a broader reasoning for our application, our team had sourced pre-trained AI models from GitHub repositories that perform similar image transformations, which enabled a direct comparison between traditional computer vision methods and AI-based approaches. Our teamâ€™s objective was to evaluate the differences in output quality, performance, and practicality between these two different methods. The development process for our project involved designing the GUI, integrating transformation algorithms, selecting appropriate AI models, and comparing the results. The results show both the strengths and limitations of each method, providing insights into when traditional techniques or AI models are more appropriate. This project highlights the evolving relationship between classical image processing and AI-driven techniques, offering potential directions for future work in this area.
